# Personal-Finance-Tracker
Django personal finance tracker that allows users to track their income, expenses, and savings.
A Personal Finance Tracker Django project is a web application that allows users to track their personal finances using the Django web framework. The user can input their income and expenses, and the application will calculate their net income and display it on the screen. The user can also set financial goals and track their progress towards achieving them.

The project involves using Django to create a user interface that is easy to use and visually appealing. Django provides a powerful framework for building web applications, with built-in support for databases, user authentication, and security.

The project will require the use of a database to store the user's financial data. Django provides support for multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. The database will be used to store the user's financial data and perform the necessary calculations.

The project may also include additional features such as budgeting tools, investment tracking, and financial advice. These features can be integrated into the Django application using Python code and third-party libraries.

Overall, the Personal Finance Tracker Django project is a great way to learn about web development using the Django framework and personal finance management. It is also a useful tool for anyone who wants to take control of their finances and achieve their financial goals.
